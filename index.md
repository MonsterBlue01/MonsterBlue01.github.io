## About Me

I'm a senior computer science student at UCSC, well-versed in languages such as C/C++ and Python. My academic journey has given me a solid grounding in computer system design and a budding interest in natural language processing (NLP). While my core skills revolve around programming and system design, I'm increasingly captivated by the potential of AI, specifically within the domain of NLP. Beyond programming, my interests extend to computer networks and distributed systems, as I'm eager to understand the underpinnings of our connected digital world. I'm driven by a passion to leverage technology to address complex problems, and I'm keen to explore opportunities that allow me to dive deeper into AI and system architectures.

## Projects

### Huffman Coding Implementation

This project involves an efficient Python-based implementation of Huffman Coding, a popular lossless data compression algorithm. By leveraging the properties of Huffman Coding, the program dynamically generates compressed data and respective codes.

- Dynamic Tree Building: The program constructs an optimized Huffman Tree based on input data frequencies, ensuring the most frequent characters have shorter codes.
- Lossless Compression: It maintains the integrity of the original data, allowing for flawless decompression.

### Multi-threaded HTTP Server

This project showcases a robust HTTP server constructed using C language. Built on the principles of socket programming, the server efficiently handles multiple simultaneous client requests.

- Socket Programming: The server is grounded in the fundamentals of socket programming, ensuring reliable communication over the network.
- Concurrent Client Handling: With multi-threading capabilities, the server can efficiently manage and respond to multiple client requests concurrently, providing improved response times and throughput.
- Standard Protocol Adherence: Following the HTTP protocol standards, the server can cater to common web requests and serve appropriate responses.

### RSA Encryption Implementation

This project features a secure RSA encryption algorithm crafted using C++. RSA, a widely adopted public-key cryptosystem, enables the encryption of sensitive data and ensures data integrity through decryption.

- Asymmetric Key Cryptography: Utilizing the power of public and private keys, the project ensures that encrypted data can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.
- Number Theory Foundations: The algorithm efficiently handles prime number generation, modular arithmetic, and Fermat's Little Theorem, which are fundamental to the RSA system.
- Security & Integrity: Through the RSA encryption-decryption process, the integrity of the data is maintained, ensuring that messages are securely transmitted and received without interference.

### MapReduce - Word Count in C

This project offers a rudimentary yet functional MapReduce implementation, entirely crafted in C, focusing on determining word occurrences within a text file. Adopting the core principles of distributed data processing, it breaks down the task into smaller chunks, processes them, and aggregates the results to achieve efficient word counting.

- Parallel Data Processing: By emulating the core structure of the MapReduce paradigm, the model effectively splits the input data, processes it in parallel (mapping), and then consolidates the results (reducing).
- Efficient File Handling: With the main program word_count.c, it efficiently reads the input file, invokes the Mapper and Reducer functions, and finally presents the word count results.
- Simplicity & Modularity: The separation into map_reduce.c for core functions and map_reduce.h for declarations enables modular enhancements, making it a foundation for more complex MapReduce tasks in C.

### Distributed Chat Application in Java

This project showcases a sophisticated chat application developed using Java, offering a seamless experience for real-time communication across distributed systems. The application facilitates server-client interactions, ensuring instant message broadcasting and efficient handling of multiple clients.

- Distributed Real-time Communication: Using a centralized server, the system enables real-time chat capabilities, ensuring that messages broadcasted by one client are instantly relayed to all other clients connected to the system.
- User Authentication System: Beyond just chatting, users have the ability to create accounts, sign in, and sign out, fostering a secure environment for communication. The application has dedicated modules like User.java and Database.java to handle user data and authentication processes.
- Design & Documentation: Along with a robust system design, the project provides comprehensive documentation and sketches that elucidate the key components and their interactions, ensuring easy onboarding for developers and users alike.
